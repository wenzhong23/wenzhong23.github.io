<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Biography</h2>

Currently, I work as a Postdoc with **Prof. Manoochehr Shirzaei** within the [EOI lab](https://www.eoivt.com/) in the Department of Geosciences at Virginia Tech. My research focuses on the modeling and projecting land subsidence using deep learning. During my phd studies, I work with **Prof. Hua Zhang** at the [WESA Lab](https://www.wesalab.com/home). My study focuses on an innovative analysis of land subsidence and its potential impact on water infrastructure as well as thereafter flood risk. During my master period, I work with **Prof. Tingjun Zhang** and focused on the investigation of permafrost deformation using terrestrial LiDAR and UAV technologies. 

I obtained PhD degree in Geospatial Computer Science from Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi in May 2024, as well as bachelor and master degree in Geographic Information Science from Lanzhou University in June 2016 and 2019, respectively.   

Overall, my research focuses on **land subsidence** (InSAR, LiDAR, UAS photogrammetry), **deep learning**, and **flooding analysis**.

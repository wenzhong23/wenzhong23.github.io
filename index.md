I am a phd candidate in the [Geospatial Computer Science Program](https://www.tamucc.edu/programs/graduate-programs/geospatial-computer-science-phd.php) at [Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi](https://www.tamucc.edu/), where I work with [Prof. Hua Zhang](https://www.tamucc.edu/files/php/views/faculty-details.php?profile=Hua_Zhang) at the [WESA Lab](https://www.wesalab.com/home). During my master from 2016 to 2019, I work with [Prof. Tingjun Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OUllNR0AAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Lanzhou University](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from Lanzhou University. 

My research focuses on **land subsidence** (InSAR, LiDAR, UAS photogrammetry), **flooding analysis** and **machine learning**.

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Biography</h2>

I am a phd candidate enrolled in the [Geospatial Computer Science Program](https://www.tamucc.edu/programs/graduate-programs/geospatial-computer-science-phd.php) at [Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi](https://www.tamucc.edu/). My current research focuses on an innovative analysis of land subsidence and its potential impact on water infrastructure as well as thereafter flood risk. During my phd studies, I work with [Prof. Hua Zhang](https://www.tamucc.edu/files/php/views/faculty-details.php?profile=Hua_Zhang) at the [WESA Lab](https://www.wesalab.com/home). During my master period, I work with [Prof. Tingjun Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OUllNR0AAAAJ&hl=en) and focused on the investigation of permafrost deformation using terrestrial LiDAR and UAV technologies. I obtained bachelor's and master's degree in Geographic Information Science from [Lanzhou University](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/) in 2016 and 2019, respectively.


My research focuses on **land subsidence** (InSAR, LiDAR, UAS photogrammetry), **flooding analysis** and **machine learning**.

    description: This study first attempts to integrate InSAR and airborne LiDAR methods to investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of coastal subsidence. By examining and comparing about 30-m InSAR results and 1-m airborne LiDAR results, this study found that, over the highly subsided area, airborne LiDAR could complement InSAR results by shedding light on the subpixel variations of InSAR results and identifying significant surface changes that InSAR cannot capture.

    description: With seven terrestrial LiDAR datasets collected from April 11, 2016 to June 16, 2018, we revealed that thermokarst landforms in our study site developed consistently with seasonal ground temperature change and were triggered significantly by extreme precipitation events. Particularly, the vertical deformation and headwall retreat of thermokarst landforms reached âˆ’3.364 m and 10.66 m during the monitoring period, respectively.
